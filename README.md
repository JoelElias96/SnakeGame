# Snake Game 🐍

Welcome to the **Snake Game**! This is a classic version of the snake game developed using Python's `turtle` module. In this game, you control the snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with walls or your own tail.

## Features 🎮

- **Smooth Movement**: Control the snake's direction with the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Growing Snake**: Every time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- **Wall Collision Detection**: The snake dies if it runs into a wall.
- **Self Collision Detection**: The snake dies if it runs into itself.
- **Game Reset**: After losing, the snake resets to its initial size.

## How to Play 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Use the arrow keys to guide the snake:
   - **Up**: Move up
   - **Down**: Move down
   - **Left**: Move left
   - **Right**: Move right

5. The objective is to eat the food and grow longer without hitting the walls or yourself!
